# ft_irc - Crafting Your Own IRC Server 🌐


Welcome to the world of ft_irc, where you'll embark on a journey to forge your very own **Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server**. This project invites you to explore the intricacies of **real-time communication protocols**, connecting computers in the vast expanse of the Internet. By the end, you'll have sculpted an IRC server, a testament to your mastery of **networking** and **C++** sorcery. 🚀💬

## Project Overview 🌐

ft_irc immerses you in the fascinating landscape of IRC, unraveling the threads of communication that weave through the Internet. This venture beckons you to create a robust **server** capable of handling **multiple clients**, all connected in a synchronous dance. You'll navigate the challenges of non-blocking I/O, poll(), and the elegance of C++ code. 🌐💡

## Key Features 🛠️

   - Develop an executable, **ircserv**, that listens on a specified port with a connection password. 🔐

   - Achieve **non-blocking** I/O operations, forbidding the use of forking. 🚫🍴

   - Embrace the power of a **single poll()** to orchestrate the symphony of operations. 🎶

   - Connect multiple **clients** seamlessly, forwarding messages like a maestro. 📨

   - **Channel** the spirit of IRC by implementing user authentication, nicknames, private messages, and more. 💼💬

   - Unleash channel operators with commands like **KICK**, **INVITE**, **TOPIC**, and **MODE**. 🕵️🛠️


## In Conclusion 🏁

ft_irc is your passage to becoming a maestro of IRC servers, forging a creation that stands tall in the digital landscape. Dive into the realm of sockets, signals, and channel commands. Your clean code will be the melody, and your server will echo through the interconnected world of IRC. Happy coding! 🚀👨‍💻💬
